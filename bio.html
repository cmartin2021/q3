	<p class="friendp">I have lived in many places during my lifetime. Being a nomadic person, I have developed many good friendships. I am very approachable, trustworthy person, which allows the skills to make friends. All though it is hard to maintain long distance friendship, with social media it makes it easier to stay in contact. I still will dm, text, or snapchat many of the friends I have made. </p>

I am the best son in my family, which is a hard competition to lose.</p>
